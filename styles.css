/* Step 8
The vh unit stands for viewport height, and is relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.

It is time to spruce the project up with some CSS. Begin by giving the body a width of 100%, and a height of 100vh. */

/* Step 9
Now, get rid of the horizontal scroll-bar, by setting the body default margin added by some browsers to 0 */

/* Step 10
That is better. Now, make the background easy on the eyes, by changing the body background-color to #1b1b32. Then, to see the text, change the color to #f5f6f7. */

/* Step 42
The HTML for the registration form is finished. Now, you can spruce it up a bit.

Start by changing the font to Tahoma, and the font size to 16px in the body. */

body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  background-color:#1b1b32;
  color: #f5f6f7;
  font-family: Tahoma;
  font-size: 16px;
}

/* Step 43
Center the h1 and p elements by giving them a margin of 1em auto. Then, align their text in the center as well. */

h1,p {
  margin: 1em auto;
  text-align:center;
}

/* Step 16
The rem unit stands for root em, and is relative to the font size of the html element.

As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed side by side on the same line, making their text hard to read. To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element, and add a margin of 0.5rem 0, to separate them from each other. */

label {
  display:block;
  margin:0.5rem 0;
}
