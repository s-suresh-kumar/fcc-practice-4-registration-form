<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Step 2
Below the DOCTYPE, add an html element with a lang attribute set to en, so that you have a place to start putting some code.
Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element. -->
<html lang="en">
<!-- Step 4
Add a title and a meta element to the head. Give your project a title of Registration Form, and give a charset attribute with a value of UTF-8 to your meta element.
 -->

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!-- <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> -->
  <!-- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> -->
  <title>Registration Form</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<body>

  <h1>Registration Form</h1>

  <!-- Step 7
Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register: -->

  <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>

  <!-- Step 11
  As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org. -->

  <!-- Step 12
  The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
  
  Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request.
   <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org"></form>
-->

  <!-- Step 13
As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the form element. -->

  <form method="post" action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org">

    <!-- Step 14
    The first fieldset will hold name, email, and password fields. Start by adding four label elements to the first fieldset. -->

    <fieldset>
      <label></label>
      <label></label>
      <label></label>
      <label></label>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset></fieldset>
    <fieldset></fieldset>

  </form>
