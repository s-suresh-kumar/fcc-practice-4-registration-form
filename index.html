<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Step 2
Below the DOCTYPE, add an html element with a lang attribute set to en, so that you have a place to start putting some code.
Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element. -->
<html lang="en">
<!-- Step 4
Add a title and a meta element to the head. Give your project a title of Registration Form, and give a charset attribute with a value of UTF-8 to your meta element.
 -->

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!-- <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> -->
  <!-- <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> -->
  <title>Registration Form</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

<body>

  <h1>Registration Form</h1>

  <!-- Step 7
Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register: -->

  <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>

  <!-- Step 11
  As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org. -->

  <!-- Step 12
  The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
  
  Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request.
   <form action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org"></form>
-->

  <!-- Step 13
As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the form element. -->

  <form method="post" action="https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org">

    <!-- Step 14
    The first fieldset will hold name, email, and password fields. Start by adding four label elements to the first fieldset. -->

    <fieldset>

      <!-- Step 15
      Add the following text to the label elements:
      
      Enter Your First Name:
      Enter Your Last Name:
      Enter Your Email:
      Create a New Password: -->

      <!-- Step 17
      Nest an input element within each label. Be sure to add each input after the label text, and include a space after the colon.       
      <label>Enter Your First Name:</label>
      <label>Enter Your Last Name:</label>
      <label>Enter Your Email:</label>
      <label>Create a New Password:</label>
    -->

    <!-- Step 18Passed
Following accessibility best practices, link the input elements and the label elements together using the for attribute.

Use first-name, last-name, email, and new-password as values for the respective id attributes. 
    <label>Enter Your First Name: <input>
    </label>
    <label>Enter Your Last Name: <input>
    </label>
    <label>Enter Your Email: <input>
    </label>
    <label>Create a New Password: <input>
    </label> 
  -->

  <!-- Step 20
The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.

To handle the form submission, after the last fieldset element add an input element with the type attribute set to submit and the value attribute set to Submit.
<label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input type="input" id="first-name" /></label>
  <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input type="input" id="last-name" /></label>
  <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input type="email" id="email" /></label>
  <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input type="password" id="new-password" /></label> -->

  <!-- Step 21
At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.

To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset.

Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message.
<label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input type="input" id="first-name" /></label>
  <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input type="input" id="last-name" /></label>
  <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input type="email" id="email" /></label>
  <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input type="password" id="new-password" /></label> -->


  <!-- Step 22
  Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.
  
  Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.
  <label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input required id="first-name" type="text" /></label>
  <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input required id="last-name" type="text" /></label>
  <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input required id="email" type="email" /></label>
  <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input required id="new-password" type="password" /></label>    -->

  <!-- Step 23
  With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be considered valid.
  
  Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
  
  The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out.
  <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input minlength=8 id="new-password" type="password" required /></label> -->

  <!-- Step 24
  Let us go to the next part of the registration form. This section will ask for the type of account the user is opening, and will confirm the user has read the terms and conditions.
  
  Start by adding three label elements to the second fieldset. -->

 

  <label for="first-name">Enter Your First Name: <input id="first-name" type="text" required /></label>
  <label for="last-name">Enter Your Last Name: <input id="last-name" type="text" required /></label>
  <label for="email">Enter Your Email: <input id="email" type="email" required /></label>
  <label for="new-password">Create a New Password: <input pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}" id="new-password" type="password" required /></label>
</fieldset>
    <fieldset>
  <!-- Step 25
Users will be allowed to choose either a Personal Account or Business Account.

To do this, within each of the first two label elements, add one input element with type="radio".-->

<!-- Step 26
For the terms and conditions, add an input with a type of checkbox to the third label element. Make this input element required because users should not sign up without reading the terms and conditions. -->

<!-- Step 27
Within each corresponding label element, and immediately after the input element, add a space and add the following text:

Personal Account
Business Account
I accept the terms and conditions -->

<!-- Step 28
You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However, the form does not know the radio inputs are related.

To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type. Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time. -->

<!-- Step 30
To finish this fieldset off, link the text terms and conditions in the third label to the following location:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/ -->

      <label for="personal-account"><input id="personal-account" name="account-type" type="radio" > Personal Account </label>
      <label for="business-account"><input id="business-account" name="account-type" type="radio" > Business Account</label>
      <label for="terms-and-conditions"><input id="terms-and-conditions" required type="checkbox"> I accept the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/terms-of-service/">terms and conditions</a></label>

    </fieldset>

    <!-- Step 31
    Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?
    
    Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: , and nest an input accepting a file upload. -->

    <!-- Step 32
    Add another label after the first, with the text Input your age (years): . Then, nest an input with the type of number.
    
    Next, add a min attribute to the input with a value of 13 because users under the age of 13 should not register. Also, users probably will not be over the age of 120; add a max attribute with a value of 120.
    
    Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range, a warning will appear, and the form will not submit. Give it a try. -->
    
    <!-- Step 33
    Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element. The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements require closing tags.
    
    Start, by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then, nest 5 option elements within the select element. -->

    <!-- Step 34
    Nest the select element (with its option elements) within a label element with the text How did you hear about us?. The text should come before the select element. -->

    <!-- Step 35
    The dropdown options are currently empty. To give them content, add the following text to each subsequent option element:
    
    (select one)
    freeCodeCamp News
    freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel
    freeCodeCamp Forum
    Other
    <option></option>
    <option></option>
    <option></option>
    <option></option>
    <option></option> -->
    
    <!-- Step 36
    Submitting the form with an option selected would not send a useful value to the server. As such, each option needs to be given a value attribute. Without which, the text content of the option will be submitted to the server.
    
    Give the first option a value of "", and the subsequent option elements value attributes from 1 to 4.
    <option>(select one)</option>
    <option>freeCodeCamp News</option>
    <option>freeCodeCamp YouTube Channel</option>
    <option>freeCodeCamp Forum</option>
    <option>Other</option> -->

    <fieldset>
      <label >Upload a profile picture: <input type="file"></label>
      <label >Input your age (years): <input type="number" min="13" max="120"></label>
